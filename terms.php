                            Relationship Repo’s payment feature only with the involvement of your parent or guardian. Total pricing may
                            include taxes, fees, or other miscellaneous costs, all of which you are responsible for funding. If you purchase
                             a subscription to a service, we will bill your funding instrument immediately, and then again at the beginning
                             of each subscription period. If a free trial is offered and you do not cancel within the trial period, you will
                              be billed at the end of the trial period and subsequently billed at the beginning of each subscription period.
                               A subscription can be cancelled at any time by requesting a cancellation through your My Account page. We
                               reserve the right to revoke your payment ability as well as any services you have subscribed to at any point
                               in time. </p><p>
                             Members known as “Agents” on the Relationship Repo website are subjected to a monthly subscription fee. This
                             fee is subject to change at any time and must be paid at the beginning of the subscription period. Members
                             known as “Users” on the Relationship Repo website are subjected to a flat rate fee per each case they choose
                             to create. This fee is subject to change at any time and must be paid prior to the case being posted to
                             Relationship Repo’s system. Failure to pay any fees will result in the Agent or User account being deleted and
                             may result in the banning of the user IP address or further legal action being taken.</p></div>
