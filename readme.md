# TODO's

## Plan A

### New Agent Registration Page

Agents will register on this page and trigger an email to myself and Karl.
Redirect to a success page. Upon email receipt, figure out payment for first
month and manually set agent up with an account. Send credentials upon payment.
Perhaps attach some sort of alert system for when payment for the month is due.?
Perhaps only release logins on the first of the month for new agents?
Agents will pay a flat monthly rate. They can accept an unlimited amount of cases per month. All contract details must be worked out between the user and the agents
with no liability to Relationship Repo.


### Cases


Function similar to a blog. Users post their case to the forum which is only permissible to be seen by agents. Agent is responsible for contacting a user if they are interested in their case. Probably through a mailto: for now. Users and Agent work out terms and contract amongst themselves. User will delete the post once case is accepted or upon cancelling the case. The agent who took the caes need not be reported as disclaimer will waive us of any involvement past posting their case (think craigslist). However, WE WILL want to keep track of if the case has been accepted or if the user is simply deleting the case (and if so, why).


## Plan B

### Case Creation

If the user does not have a case, then the user would click a create case button from his or her dashboard. This will take the user to a list of agents to choose from. Once an agent is selected, the user will upload any information about the case. This information will be stored in a new table that will be named xUsernameAgentname where x is the number of cases the user has had. At the end of this payment will be collected a one time fee from the user.


## Plan C

### Payment

Paypal donation on the dashboard.
